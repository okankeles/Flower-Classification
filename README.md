# Flower Classification (Cicek Siniflandirma)

Flower Classification is a C# project that classifies flowers from the Iris dataset using a simple neural network. The project reads data from the `iris` dataset, scales the input values, initializes weights, and trains the network using different learning rates and epoch counts. The main functionalities of the project include:

- **Loading Dataset:** Reads and parses the Iris dataset from the embedded resources.
- **Data Scaling:** Scales input features to the 0-1 range.
- **Weight Initialization:** Randomly initializes the weights of the neurons.
- **Training:** Trains the neural network with various learning rates and epoch counts, adjusting weights based on the error.
- **Testing:** Tests the trained network and outputs the classification accuracy.

The project demonstrates basic neural network operations and can serve as a foundation for learning neural network implementation in C#.
